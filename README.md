# SquareGame
Only works on Codeskulptor


This is the basic square game that we all played back in 3rd grade
Click a line to fill it in
If you fill in the last line of a square, you get a point
You can tell whose turn it is by the color of the lines at the bottom
Pro tip: Try to get two squares at once to get more points!
